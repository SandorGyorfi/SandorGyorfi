---

I've recently picked up React to boost my front-end skills and am also getting into C languages and R, aiming to expand my know-how and versatility in tech.


### Entering the Tech Industry

As a recent graduate, I want to apply my web development knowledge in the tech industry. I am seeking entry-level and junior jobs in the technology sector. My sales experience has taught me client interaction and solution-oriented techniques, which I am delighted to employ in a dynamic tech environment.

## Professional Interests

Both front-end and back-end coding are very interesting to me. Even though I already learnt a lot about web coding, I'm ready to start at any level and learn and grow in any way the technology takes me. I find it interesting how web development is always changing, especially how quickly front-end technologies are getting better and how strong back-end systems are.

## Hobbies

I like to show my creativity through music production, especially making music for films, when I'm not writing code. Making things is one of my hobbies. It helps me think more deeply and figure out how to solve problems, which are both good for my personal development.

Travelling is another thing I love to do that expands my view and gives me new ideas and energy to bring back to work. When I'm in, I like to watch films and TV shows or study something new.
